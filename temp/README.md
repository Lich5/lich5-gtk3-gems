# GTK3 Binary Gems for Lich5 - Brainstorming Documents

**Date:** 2025-12-28
**Session Type:** Planning & Brainstorming
**Status:** Ready for Implementation

---

## Document Overview

This package contains four comprehensive planning documents for building GTK3 binary gems for Lich5:

### 1. GTK3_BINARY_GEMS_PLANNING.md
**Purpose:** High-level overview and project planning

**Contents:**
- Complete GTK3 gem ecosystem (10 core gems + dependencies)
- Binary gem architecture explained
- Platform targets and considerations
- Build pipeline architecture
- Distribution strategy (bundled with Lich5)
- Risk assessment
- Timeline estimates (5-8 weeks to production)
- Next steps and action items

**Read this first** for the big picture.

---

### 2. GTK3_BINARY_GEMS_TECHNICAL_CHALLENGES.md
**Purpose:** Deep dive into technical challenges and solutions

**Contents:**
- Why ruby-gnome stopped providing binary gems
- Cross-compilation vs native compilation analysis
- GTK3 runtime library bundling (50-70 libraries!)
- Dynamic library loading strategies
- Icon themes and data files
- Debugging and troubleshooting approaches
- Build system design patterns
- Licensing considerations (LGPL compliance)
- Long-term maintenance strategy
- Alternative approaches considered and rejected

**Read this** to understand the technical complexity and decision rationale.

---

### 3. GTK3_BINARY_GEMS_REPOSITORY_SCAFFOLDING.md
**Purpose:** Complete repository structure and scaffolding guide

**Contents:**
- Repository naming recommendation (`lich5-gtk3-gems`)
- Complete directory structure with explanations
- Essential files with actual code:
  - GitHub Actions workflows (build, test, release)
  - Rakefile (master build script)
  - Build automation scripts (Ruby and Bash)
  - Test suite
  - Documentation templates
- Vendor library organization
- Phase-by-phase scaffolding tasks (2-3 weeks)
- Quick start checklist (1 day to first gem!)

**Read this** when setting up the new repository.

---

### 4. GTK3_BINARY_GEMS_VENDOR_LIBRARY_ACQUISITION.md
**Purpose:** Detailed strategy for acquiring and managing GTK3 libraries

**Contents:**
- Platform-specific library sources:
  - Windows: MSYS2 (recommended)
  - macOS: Homebrew (Intel and ARM)
  - Linux: System packages (recommended)
- Automated dependency discovery tools
- Vendor directory organization
- Storage strategy:
  - POC: On-demand download
  - Production: GitHub Releases (free!)
- Versioning and update strategy
- License compliance checklist
- Complete automation scripts
- Testing and verification

**Read this** when acquiring GTK3 libraries for bundling.

## Key Decisions Summary

### Technical Approach
✅ **Native compilation via GitHub Actions** (not cross-compilation)
- Simpler, more reliable, easier debugging
- Free for public repositories
- Parallel builds across platforms

✅ **Platform-specific binary gems** (not "fat" gems)
- Modern RubyGems standard
- Example: `gtk3-4.3.4-x64-mingw32.gem`

✅ **Bundle GTK3 runtime libraries** (~150-200MB per platform)
- Zero external dependencies for users
- DLLs/dylibs included in gem's `vendor/` directory

### Distribution Strategy
✅ **Bundle with Lich5 installer** (not published to RubyGems.org)
- Complete control
- No naming conflicts
- Single unified installer
- Zero ongoing gem server maintenance

### Repository & Infrastructure
✅ **Repository:** `lich5-gtk3-gems` (recommended name)
✅ **Organization:** Lich5 (or your Lich5 org)
✅ **Visibility:** Public (for free GitHub Actions)
✅ **Cost:** $0.00 for 2 builds/year on public repo

### Vendor Library Storage
✅ **POC/Development:** Download on-demand from MSYS2/Homebrew
✅ **Production:** Package as tarballs, upload to GitHub Releases
✅ **CI/CD:** Download from GitHub Release with caching

## Timeline Estimates

### Proof of Concept (POC)
**Goal:** Build single gem (glib2) for Windows with bundled DLLs
**Time:** 1-2 weeks

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
**Goal:** All 10 gems for all platforms, basic testing
**Time:** 4-5 weeks

### Production Ready
**Goal:** Full CI/CD, comprehensive testing, documentation
**Time:** 6-8 weeks total

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Implementation)
1. Review all four brainstorming documents
2. Validate decisions with stakeholders
3. Create repository: `Lich5/lich5-gtk3-gems`
4. Set up initial directory structure

### Phase 1: POC (Week 1-2)
1. Set up Windows build environment (MSYS2)
2. Download GTK3 vendor libraries
3. Import glib2 source from ruby-gnome
4. Build first binary gem with bundled DLLs
5. Test on clean Windows VM

### Phase 2: Full Build (Week 3-5)
1. Import all 10 gem sources
2. Create build automation (Rakefile)
3. Set up GitHub Actions
4. Build for all platforms
5. Integration testing

### Phase 3: Lich5 Integration (Week 6-8)
1. Bundle gems in Lich5 Windows installer
2. Bundle gems in Lich5 macOS .app
3. Bundle gems in Lich5 Linux AppImage
4. End-to-end testing
5. Release!

## Questions to Resolve Before Starting

1. **Ruby version:** Lock to Ruby 3.3.0 or support range?
2. **GTK3 version:** Use latest (3.24.43) or lock to older stable?
3. **Repository organization:** Create under existing org or new org?
4. **Linux strategy:** Bundle for AppImage or rely on system GTK3?
