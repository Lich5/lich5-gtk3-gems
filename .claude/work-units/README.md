# Work Units Directory

This directory contains work unit specifications - the handoff protocol between planning and implementation.

## Structure

```
work-units/
├── CURRENT.md    # The active work unit (create this when you have work)
└── archive/      # Completed work units
```

---

## CURRENT.md

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for "what I'm working on right now"

**Created by:** Architecture mode (`/arch`) or Product Owner

**Executed by:** Implementation mode (`/code`)

**Contains:**
- Feature/task description
- Acceptance criteria
- Context and constraints
- Technical notes
- References

---

## Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase (`/arch` mode)

Create `CURRENT.md` with specifications:

```markdown
# Work Unit: [Feature Name]

## Description
[What needs to be built]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Context
[Why this matters, how it fits in the system]

## Technical Constraints
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

## References
- [Link to design doc]
- [Link to issue]
```

### 2. Implementation Phase (`/code` mode)

1. Read CURRENT.md
2. Implement according to acceptance criteria
3. Check off criteria as completed
4. When all criteria met, work unit is complete

### 3. Completion

**CRITICAL:** Archive CURRENT.md before creating new work unit

**Why:**
- Keeps CURRENT.md accurate (always shows active work)
- Prevents GitHub search pollution
- Provides fast filesystem search (VSCode, Spotlight)
- Maintains git history and commit traceability

**Hybrid Archive Approach:**

1. **Before archiving** - Add git commit history to CURRENT.md:
   ```markdown
   ## Git Commits (Parent → Final)

   **Parent Commit:** `abc1234` - feat(glib2): first commit
   - `def5678` - feat(glib2): second commit
   **Final Commit:** `def5678`

   **PR:** #123 - feat(all): PR title
   **PR Merge:** `mno7890` (merged to main)
   ```

2. **Archive to filesystem** with date-based naming:
   ```bash
   mv .claude/work-units/CURRENT.md \
      .claude/work-units/archive/2025-12-30-feature-name.md
   ```

3. **Commit the archive** to git:
   ```bash
   git add .claude/work-units/archive/2025-12-30-feature-name.md
   git commit -m "chore(all): archive work unit - feature name"
   ```

**See:** `docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` for complete process

---

## Archive Directory

**Organization:** Date-based with embedded git commit tracking

```
archive/
├── 2025-12-28-build-glib2-gem.md
├── 2025-12-29-add-gtk3-support.md
└── 2025-12-30-nokogiri-binary-gem.md
```

Each archived work unit contains:
- Complete work unit specification
- Git commit history (parent → final)
- PR reference and merge commit
- Traceability to code changes

---

## When to Use Work Units

**Use for:**
- Complex features with multiple components
- Changes requiring architectural decisions
- Tasks with unclear requirements (force clarification)
- Anything that needs handoff between planning and implementation

**Optional for:**
- Simple bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- Style/lint fixes
- Single-file trivial changes

**Customize:** Define your criteria in `DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md`

---

## Tips

**Good work units:**
- Clear, specific acceptance criteria
- Provide context (why, not just what)
- Include constraints and edge cases
- Reference relevant docs/issues
- Testable criteria (you know when you're done)

**Bad work units:**
- Vague requirements ("make it better")
- No acceptance criteria
- Assume knowledge not captured
- Missing constraints
- Unclear completion state

---

**Remember:** The work unit is a contract. Make it clear enough that implementation mode (or another person) can execute it without guessing.
