# Testing Mode

Focus on comprehensive testing for your codebase.

**Testing priorities:**
1. Write clear, descriptive test cases
2. Follow testing framework best practices
3. Test both happy paths and edge cases
4. Mock external dependencies appropriately
5. Ensure tests are fast and isolated
6. Verify test coverage for critical paths

**Common patterns:**
- Unit tests for individual methods/classes
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Regression tests for bug fixes
- Fixture/factory usage for test data
- Proper setup/teardown in before/after blocks

**Quality standards:**
- Tests should be as well-documented as production code
- One assertion per test (generally)
- Clear failure messages
- Independent and repeatable
