# Session Initialization

**Claude session startup protocol.**

Reading core documents to establish context before work assignment...

## Step 1: Core Philosophy
- [ ] `.claude/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - Project goal, architecture, current phase
- [ ] `.claude/docs/CLI_PRIMER.md` - Development philosophy, testing requirements, commit standards
- [ ] `.claude/docs/SOCIAL_CONTRACT.md` - Team agreements and collaboration expectations

## Step 2: Workflow Standards
- [ ] `.claude/docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` - Branch strategy, test-first approach, validation checklist
- [ ] `.claude/docs/SESSION_INIT_CHECKLIST.md` - Session continuity protocol and context recovery
- [ ] `docs/DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` - Documentation requirements and regression rules

## Step 3: Current Status Report
After reading, report:
- Git branch and status
- Recent commits (last 3-5) to understand current work
- Any active work units in `.claude/work-units/CURRENT.md`
- Full understanding of core contracts and expectations
- Key project fact: This project validates BUILD CORRECTNESS, not upstream functionality
- Readiness for work assignment

**You are now initialized and ready for work.**
