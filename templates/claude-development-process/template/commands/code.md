# Implementation Mode

**Switching to implementation mode with Haiku for efficient execution.**

Focus on:
- Executing work units from `.claude/work-units/CURRENT.md`
- Writing clean, efficient code
- Following established patterns in the codebase
- Writing comprehensive tests (unit, integration, regression)
- Running full validation (tests + style checks)
- Committing with proper conventions
- Pushing to designated branches

**Full toolkit available** - efficient execution mode.

**Quality checklist before pushing:**
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Style/lint checks passing
- [ ] Zero regression verified
- [ ] Code documented
- [ ] Committed with proper format
- [ ] Ready for review

**Remember:** Mark work unit complete and archive before starting new work.
